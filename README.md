SUD engine.
It's made as a university project, but if it gets good, I might make it public one day.
Basically, it should be more of a engine for SUDs then a SUD itself. I'm aiming for generic engine that would allow me to do beautiful things. I will see about that, because deadline can verify that(and I might end up making simple SUD game in a beautiful spaghetti code).
Help is always welcome!

Post mortem:

Turns out there wasn't enough time(is that even surprising?). The game is basically not finished, and is more of a game than an engine; however, it is generic enough that items, NPCs and locations aren't hard-coded. Also, it's kind of playable in the sense that you may create a world and use it as a place for simple adventure game; plus, its design isn't that bad, really; which means that you can extend it without worrying too much about breaking things, although should the game get bigger, there would be problem of regexps that can get to the point where you would cover one sentence with few regexps.

Since I got no time for such project, it's now suspended indefinitely. I doubt that I'll find time to continue it, but it shows some potential.
