SUD engine.
It's made as a university project, but if it gets good, I might make it public one day.
Basically, it should be more of a engine for SUDs then a SUD itself. I'm aiming for generic engine that would allow me to do beautiful things. I will see about that, because deadline can verify that(and I might end up making simple SUD game in a beautiful spaghetti code).
Help is always welcome!
